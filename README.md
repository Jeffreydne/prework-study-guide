# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This study guide was created for UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Coding Bootcamp students who are going through the prework modules. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript and I used each of those to build it.

## Credits
I initially turned this in as a student in fulltime boot camp that started September 2023. After 1 week I decided to switch into the parttime boot camp and since that time I have made a number of modifications to this file. The basic template and the cat image on the header are from the UC Berkeley extension prework module.
